# ONE THING

**Stop planning. Finish something.**

ONE THING is not a productivity app.
It’s a constraint.

You are allowed to add **one task**.
That’s it.

No lists.
No priorities.
No hiding.

## Why this exists

Most to-do apps help you *feel* productive.
They help you plan, rearrange, color-code, and postpone.

ONE THING does the opposite.

It removes your ability to pretend.

---

## How it works

- Add **one** task
- You cannot add another
- Finish it → streak increases
- Miss a day → streak resets
- One quiet reminder per day

Finish the task.
Or admit you won’t.

---

## This app is NOT for you if

- You want complex systems
- You like managing lists more than doing work
- You need motivation, quotes, or confetti

This app will frustrate you.
That’s the point.

---

## This app IS for you if

- You over-plan
- You procrastinate productively
- You’re tired of lying to yourself

ONE THING doesn’t motivate you.
It removes your escape routes.
