# ONE THING

**Focus on one task. Finish it. Repeat.**

ONE THING is a minimalist Android app designed to fight fake productivity.
No endless to-do lists. No priorities. No noise.

You choose **one task**.
You either finish it — or you don’t.

---

## Why this app exists

Most to-do apps help you feel busy.
They don’t help you finish anything.

ONE THING is built on a simple rule:

> You can only have one active task at a time.

That constraint is the feature.

---

## How it works

- Add **one** task
- The app blocks you from adding another
- Finish it → streak increases
- Miss a day → streak resets
- Gentle daily reminder, no spam
- Dark mode supported

That’s it.

---

## Who this is for

- People who procrastinate by planning
- People tired of “productivity” apps
- People who want accountability, not features

If you like complex systems and endless customization, this app will annoy you.
That’s intentional.
